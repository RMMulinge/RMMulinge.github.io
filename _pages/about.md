I bridge the gap between software development and IT infrastructure, bringing a unique blend of skills that allows me to not only build applications but also understand and maintain the systems that power them. My expertise spans:

- **Full-Stack Development** with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
- **Desktop Application Development** using C# and .NET framework
- **IT Infrastructure Management** including network administration, hardware maintenance, and security implementations
- **System Integration** and troubleshooting across various technology stacks

- User support and technical issue resolution across multiple branches

This role has given me exposure to enterprise-level IT operations while strengthening my problem-solving skills in live environments.

## üéØ My Passion Projects

I believe in learning by doing, which is why I consistently work on personal projects:
- Building a **full-stack blog application** to master the MERN stack

- Creating **responsive portfolio websites** to hone my front-end skills

## üå± Continuous Learning

I'm actively expanding my knowledge through:
- **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification track

I'm eager to contribute to teams that value innovation, continuous learning, and practical problem-solving. When I'm not coding or troubleshooting networks, you can find me reading tech blogs, participating in coding competitions, or exploring new frameworks and technologies.
